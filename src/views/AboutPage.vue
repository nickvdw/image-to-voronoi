      This application was made as part of a research paper on transforming images into Voronoi diagrams based on the <i>n</i>-nearest centroids. <br>
      This was done for the course [2IMV10] Visual Computing Project at the University of Technology in Eindhoven. <br>
      For those who are interested and want to indulge themselves into technical details, the paper regarding this application can be found here.<br><br>

      Furthermore, we would like to thank our supervisor Michael Burch for providing us with the necessary feedback.
