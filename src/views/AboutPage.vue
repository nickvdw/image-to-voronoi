      Voronoier was brought to you by these wonderful people:

      This application was made as part of a research paper on transforming
      images into Voronoi diagrams based on the <i>n</i>-nearest centroids.
      <br />
      This was done for the course [2IMV10] Visual Computing Project at the
      University of Technology in Eindhoven. <br />
      For those who are interested and want to indulge themselves into technical
      details, the paper regarding this application can be found here.<br /><br />

      Furthermore, we would like to thank our supervisor Michael Burch for
      providing us with the necessary feedback during the project.
