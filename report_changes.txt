We have improved the final report based on Michael Burch's feedback.

We describe these changes on a high level in this document.
The list of detailed changes is located in the 'detailed_report_changes.txt' file.

Changes:
- We changed our shortened names to our full names (example: J. van Lith -> John van Lith).
- We went from British English to American English.
- We fixed some typos.
- We shortened paragraphs where the paragraphs ended on a line with only a few (less than 3) words such that we could add an example of order-k Voronoi diagrams for 1 <= k <= 6.
- We did a final proofread.
