Welcome to the Voronoier application developed by Group 7.

In this document, we explain various important files
located in this folder.

1. The first important file is the "README.md" file, which
functions as a manual. It explains how the application
can be accessed by either compiling the source code yourself
or navigating to the URL the application is hosted on.
In case one cannot view the "README.md" file that contains
all information about installing and running the application,
one can navigate to the following link:

https://github.com/nickvdw/image-to-voronoi/blob/master/README.md

This link contains the same content as the "README.md" file and with
working mark-up.

2. The second important file is the "report_changes.txt" file.
This file contains all changes made to the final report on a 
higher level. In case one wants to see the detailed changes,
one can open the "report_changes_detailed.txt" file. We use
these simple txt files rather than creating a big changes 
report because we only made a few changes to the final report
based on Michael Burch's feedback.

3. While not specifically located as a file within this folder,
the video that demonstrates the Voronoier application can be found
here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzt_l1i7y4Q. This video
demonstrates the latest version of the Voronoier application
described in the final report.
